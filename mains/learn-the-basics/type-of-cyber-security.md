# üéñÔ∏è Type Of Cyber Security

This repository provides an overview of various cybersecurity domains, highlighting key areas and practices essential for protecting digital assets and information.

### 1. Network Security

Network security involves protecting data as it moves through networks. Key tools and practices include:

* **Firewalls**: Devices or software designed to block unauthorized access while permitting outward communication.
* **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)**: Technologies that create a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet.

### 2. Endpoint Security

Endpoint security focuses on securing individual devices, such as computers and phones, through:

* **Antivirus Software**: Programs designed to detect and destroy computer viruses.
* **Anti-Malware Tools**: Software solutions that prevent, detect, and respond to malware threats.

### 3. Cloud Security

Cloud security ensures the safety of data and applications hosted in the cloud through:

* **Proper Configuration**: Ensuring cloud services are configured securely to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Access Controls**: Implementing policies and technologies to manage who can access cloud resources.

### 4. Application Security

Application security involves making software applications secure by:

* **Safe Coding Practices**: Writing code that is secure against vulnerabilities.
* **Regular Testing**: Continuously testing applications to identify and fix security weaknesses.

### 5. Information Security

Information security aims to keep data confidential, integral, and available by:

* **Encryption**: Encoding information to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Access Controls**: Restricting access to data based on user roles and permissions.

### 6. Security Operations (SecOps)

SecOps involves continuously monitoring, detecting, and responding to security incidents using tools like:

* **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**: Solutions that provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware.

### 7. Incident Response

Incident response entails planning for and responding to security incidents such as:

* **Data Breaches**: Unauthorized access and retrieval of sensitive information.
* **Response Plans**: Strategies and procedures to mitigate the impact of security incidents.

### 8. Mobile Security

Mobile security focuses on securing mobile devices and apps through:

* **Mobile Device Management (MDM)**: Technologies that manage, monitor, and secure mobile devices.

### 9. Industrial Control System (ICS) Security

ICS security protects critical infrastructure from cyber-physical attacks by:

* **Monitoring Systems**: Tools that observe and analyze the behavior of control systems to detect anomalies.
* **Access Restrictions**: Implementing controls to limit access to critical systems.

### 10. Internet of Things (IoT) Security

IoT security involves safeguarding connected IoT devices from potential vulnerabilities by:

* **Device Authentication**: Ensuring only authorized devices can access the network.
* **Firmware Updates**: Regularly updating device software to patch security vulnerabilities.

### 11. Blockchain Security

Blockchain security focuses on ensuring the safety of blockchain-based systems and cryptocurrencies through:

* **Cryptographic Algorithms**: Using secure algorithms to protect blockchain transactions.
* **Decentralized Control**: Reducing reliance on a central authority to enhance security.

### 12. Wireless Network Security

Wireless network security aims to secure wireless communication channels, such as Wi-Fi, from attacks by:

* **Encryption Protocols**: Using strong encryption to protect wireless data transmissions.
* **Network Monitoring**: Continuously observing network traffic to detect suspicious activities.

### 13. Physical Security

Physical security involves using access controls and surveillance to protect data centers and critical infrastructure by:

* **Access Controls**: Implementing physical barriers and authorization protocols to restrict access to sensitive areas.
* **Surveillance Systems**: Deploying cameras and sensors to monitor and secure facilities.
